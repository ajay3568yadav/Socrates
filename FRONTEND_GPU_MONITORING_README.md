# Frontend GPU Monitoring Implementation

## Overview

The GPU and system monitoring information is now displayed in the frontend chat interface. Each chat response that includes performance metrics will show a "System Info" button that displays the detailed GPU usage stats that were generated for that specific prompt.

## Features Added

### 🎮 System Info Button
- **Location**: Appears at the bottom of each assistant message that has performance metrics
- **Design**: Orange button with GPU emoji "🎮 System Info"
- **Functionality**: Opens a modal with comprehensive system and GPU metrics

### 📊 Performance Metrics Modal
The modal displays the same detailed information that appears in the backend terminal:

#### ⏱️ Response Timing
- Response time in seconds
- Prompt length (characters)
- Response length (characters)

#### 💾 System Resources
- Current memory usage (GB and percentage)
- Average memory usage (last 10 readings)
- Current CPU usage percentage
- Average CPU usage (last 10 readings)

#### 🎮 GPU Information
- CUDA availability status
- GPU count and model
- GPU monitoring method (GPUtil, PyTorch, etc.)
- GPU memory usage (used/total GB and percentage)
- GPU utilization percentage
- GPU temperature (when available)

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Data Collection**
- Every chat request automatically captures performance metrics from the backend
- Metrics are stored with each assistant message
- No additional user action required

### 2. **Display Integration**
- System Info button appears for assistant messages with performance data
- Button is styled to match the existing Copy, Edit, and Compile buttons
- Available both at message level and code block level

### 3. **Modal Display**
- Click the "System Info" button to open the performance modal
- Modal shows formatted metrics in a terminal-like style
- Click outside the modal or the X button to close
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
1. Send any chat message to the assistant
2. Wait for the response to be generated
3. Look for the orange "🎮 System Info" button at the bottom of the assistant's response
4. Click the button to view detailed GPU and system metrics for that specific response

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- **Modified Components**: `Message.js`, `App.js`, `ChatView.js`
- **New CSS**: `SystemInfo.css` for modal and button styling
- **Performance Data**: Automatically captured from API responses

### Data Storage
- Performance metrics are stored with each message in the database
- Backward compatible with existing messages (graceful fallback)
- Metrics persist across sessions and chat reloads

### API Integration
- Uses existing `/api/chat` endpoint
- Performance metrics included in response under `performance_metrics` field
- No additional API calls required

## Styling & Design

### Color Scheme
- **System Info Button**: Orange (`#DA7A00`) to distinguish from other action buttons
- **Modal**: Dark theme matching the chat interface
- **Text Colors**: Green for values, red for section headers, blue for titles

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full-width modal with comfortable spacing
- **Mobile**: Responsive modal that adapts to screen size
- **Touch-friendly**: Larger buttons on mobile devices

### Animation
- Smooth modal fade-in animation
- Button hover effects and visual feedback
- Loading states for button clicks

## Benefits

✅ **Real-time insights** into GPU usage per prompt
✅ **Historical data** for performance analysis  
✅ **User-friendly interface** with intuitive design
✅ **No performance impact** on chat functionality
✅ **Backward compatible** with existing conversations
✅ **Mobile responsive** design
✅ **Same detailed info** as backend terminal output

## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Appearing
- Ensure the backend GPU monitoring is working
- Check that the chat response includes performance metrics
- Verify the backend is running the updated version

### Modal Not Opening
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure CSS files are loaded properly
- Try refreshing the page

### Missing Data
- Verify backend GPU monitoring initialization
- Check that performance metrics are being generated
- Ensure database schema supports performance_metrics field

The implementation provides the exact same comprehensive GPU monitoring you see in the backend terminal, now available directly in the frontend chat interface for easy access and analysis.
